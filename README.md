## Introduction
Welcome! This repository is a clone inspired by popular blast games. This project aims to implement clean coding principles and use various design patterns to create dynamic game mechanics using C# and Unity.
## Dependencies
This project integrates numerous external libraries. Zenject, a robust framework, has been utilized for managing dependencies.This framework enhances the modularity and sustainability of the code, making significant contributions to the project's architecture. UniTask has been used for asynchronous operations, while Naught Attributes and Toolbar Extender have been employed to enhance the Unity editor. On the other hand, DoTween is an indispensable component in this project.

## Game Structure Overview

Successful games need more than good code and design; they also require well-thought-out levels. This project has two main parts:

- Main Game: Where players can play.
- Level Generator: Where new levels are created.
